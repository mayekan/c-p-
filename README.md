 Game Design  The first step is to design the game itself. This includes creating the game mechanics, designing the graphics, and writing the code. Depending on the complexity of the game, you might need a game engine such as Unity or Unreal Engine.
This is a very basic game, but it should give you a good starting point. You can extend this code to add more features like enemies, power-ups, levels, etc. to make it more interesting.
n this code, we've added a score variable to track the player's score, a font to draw the score on the screen, and a list of items for the player to collect. In the game loop, we draw the items, check if the player has collected any items, and update the score. This gives the player a goal and makes the game more interesting.
